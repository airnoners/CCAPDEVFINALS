            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Archers Market was founded in 2023 by DLSU students to create a safe, efficient marketplace exclusively for the DLSU community. Our mission is to help students buy and sell textbooks, school supplies, electronics, and other essentials.
            </p>
            <p>
                What started as a small Facebook group has grown into a dedicated platform serving thousands of DLSU students. Our business recognizes the need for a trusted marketplace where students could easily find what they need for their academic journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Archers Market has become an essential resource for the DLSU community, helping students save money while promoting sustainability through reuse and recycling.
